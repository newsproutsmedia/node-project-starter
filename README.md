# node-project-starter
Basic starter setup for NodeJS/Express project using Scss

### Express Setup
This starter exposes the index.html page in a public directory. No express endpoints have been set up yet.

### SCSS
Also, this project uses node-sass to compile CSS. It is currently set to build a "main.css" file in the public/css folder.
To build your CSS from the terminal:
```
npm run scss
```
To build CSS, set a watch folder, and run the dev server:
```
npm run watch
```

## Dev Server Instructions
To run the dev server (on port 3000) WITHOUT first compiling CSS:
```
npm run dev
```

### Jest Testing
The project is set up to use the Jest testing framework.
Run Jest tests:
```
npm test
```
